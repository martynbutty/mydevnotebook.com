Welcome to my blog and collection of notes mainly concerning software engineering. 

Some pages are written as a reminder to myself about that particular subject matter, so please bear that in mind if it appears brief. 

I hope to produce some more in-depth articles in the future with much more detail, so check back sooon! In the [blog](/blog) section you will find articles that are more random in nature.

Hopefully you will find something useful here... but if you don't, it won't cost you anything other than your time :)
